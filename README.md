# About:
With the `docker` and `lxc` subcommand of rurima, you can search & get & unpack images from dockerhub or LXC mirror easily.      
rurima is designed to be the ruri container manager, but since the dockerhub and lxc support is done, I made them to be subcommands of rurima, so you can use these feature directly.      
# Update for docker subcommand:
`docker` subcommand now supports auto convert docker config to ruri command, to make it more esay to start the container.        
But if you just want to pull the image but don't want to see the config, use `-q` arg to  disable showing that info.      

`docker` subcommand added `config` command to just get the config of a docker image, you can use `rurima docker config -i [image] -t [tag]|grep "ruri \-w"|cat` to get ruri command to start the container.

# Download:
You can get rurima binary (staticly linked) for arm64, armv7, armhf, riscv64, i386, loong64, s390x, ppc64le and x86_64 from the release page.     
https://github.com/Moe-hacker/rurima/releases/tag/null          
# Dependent:   
rurima needs tar, xz, gzip, file, you can find these static binary for aarch64, armv7, x86_64, i386 or riscv64 inï¼š      
[tar-static](https://github.com/Moe-sushi/tar-static)      
[xz-static](https://github.com/Moe-sushi/xz-static)     
[gzip-static](https://github.com/Moe-sushi/gzip-static)     
[file-static](https://github.com/Moe-sushi/file-static)      
rurima also need `curl`, but th static build have bugs, and I found that Android 15 has a built-in curl: `/bin/curl`.          
rurima also need proot for rootless support, without proot, it might cause bugs unpacking rootfs, sadly, I failed to build proot-static, please install it manually.
